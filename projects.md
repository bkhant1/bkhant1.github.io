      alt: drunkpoker
    description: We spent quite a lot of time on zoom with my friends during the 2020 lockdown. As it is tradition in the french engineering schools, we played drinking games. <a href="https://drunkpoker.herokuapp.com/">DrunkPoker</a> is an online drinking poker game, written in elm and python. If you prefer dry fun, it's also a good place to play poker with your friends.

    description: <a href=https://github.com/bkhant1/cpp_grep>Cpp grep</a> allows you to look for attributes in nested structures in just a function call. If you see nested classes and std containers as the file system, it's equivalent to <code>grep -R search_for in_directory</code>, but <code>search_for</code> is a predicate and <code>in_directory</code> your top level class. Very useful in tests for instance, because your tests become resilient to re-organising you class structure.
  - title: <b>The Sally-Anne experiment</b>

Based on the design from my partner, researcher at UCL, I developed and deployed the Sally-Anne test online. Written in react and django.
